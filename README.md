## Snake Game - README

# Overview

This program is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with its own body.

# Features

Randomly generated apples: Apples appear at random locations on the grid, avoiding the snake's body.
Continuous movement: The snake moves in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) and wraps around the edges of the screen.
Collision detection: The game ends if the snake's head collides with its body.
Score display: The number of apples eaten is displayed on the screen.
